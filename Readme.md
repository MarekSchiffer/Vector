I hope that makes sense to people ;).
# General:
The term vector is a horrible choice for what is essential a dynamically allocated array.
Alternatively the term ListArray is also often used. The difference to an ordinarray array
is that if you put something at it's place, it stays there. a[7]= 23; is not affected by a[4]=12;
unless it's actively taken care of. The same does not hold true for a vector.
The insertion of a[4]=12, here VectorInsert(&vector,&pos,4), will effect the position of
all elements behind it. The equivalent when using a Vector is the replace function, i.e.
a[4]=12 is the same as VectorReplace(&vector,&pos,4); <br>

Of course this behaviour is often desired and greatly missed when using a standard array.
The same goes for deletion. There are never holes in a vector or undesired already removed
elements which may happen with a standard array if no extra care is taken.  <br>

The blatant advantage of using a vector is the possibility to dynamically adjust it's size.
This adjustment, based on the reallocation, is organized on the initial size times two policy.
The vector has therefore pretty much the same performance as a classic array. The only
difference being it allocated on the heap, not on the stack. <br>
